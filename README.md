# darkGCS

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a tool developed in the 1970s to help assess patients with altered mental status. It is composed of three separate sections:

Eye Opening (1-4 points)
Verbal Reponse (1-5 points)
Motor Response (1-6 points)

Each of the above sections could potentially be "Non Testable" if let's say, for example, their eyes were swollen shut. 

While the GCS is documented broken down by each of the three sections (ie E4V5M6), the GCS Score is a single value combining all three sections (GCS score 15).
The GCS score can not be calculated if any of the individual sections are "Non Testable".


# Help Needed

This is the first app I have developed (so far) all by myself. The code itself is awful with MANY if/else statements. But every time I try to refactor I break the code. 

Here is what I need help with:

1. Having the GCS and GCS score calculate correctly

2. Potentially refactor a lot of my code to make it reusable

3. Fix the image on launch screen, seems offset to one side

4. On the settings screen under adjust text size... please allow slider to dynamically change text size

5. On settings screen under app/developer info... please set "Version 2.0" to come from bundle so will update automatically.
